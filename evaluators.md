## Evauluator Guidelines

* Evaluations are pass/fail and require 100% mastery. Don't pass a student unless they confidently pass 100% of the criteria from the badge.
* Excessive fumbling around and problems during the eval session should necessitate a failure.
* Students can be evaluated multiple times for the same badge, no problem.
* If an evaluation can't be completed in the time allotted, the evaluator can make a decision on whether or not the student needs to start from zero or pick up where he/she left off in another eval.

### Badges:

- Have the student start at the top of the badge criteria and work their way down, explaining and/or demonstrating each point.
- Live demonstration is preferable but some pre-made demos are acceptible if the evaluator feels it doesn't hide a lack of mastery.

### Projects:

Project evals are slightly different and last longer (50-60 min) than badge evals. This is where they send all the relevant urls so we can try out the project application and see the code. I also have them walk me through the app functionality, pointing out details they think are important, and also telling me how the code works.

- Have the student demonstrate the application in a screen share, show off the code, talk about important pieces.
