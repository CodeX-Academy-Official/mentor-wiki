# Learner Kickoff Call

Please schedule a quick call with the learner to discuss the following points. You may need to take some notes for your own purposes.
- Your role as a mentor, resource, coach and cheerleader
- Learner’s responsibility to study independently. Mentor sessions are meant to supplement independent study.
- Stay focused on competencies for each badge. Don't over-study or over-learn. Just-in-time learning.
- How suggested learning works 
  - not required, 
  - not even suggested to complete entire lessons, 
  - just learn enough to earn the badges!
  - The items we add to suggested learning SHOULD all be free or have free options that get you what you need. 
  - If you find a course that you like that you want to pay for, that’s your option. It might be a great option especially if the price is good and the content has a lot of good user feedback. Your mentor will STILL be able to work with you if you are using our suggested content or your own. It’s still all about the badge criteria!
- Meeting types:
  - Community Events — These are events put on by companies or individuals to highlight something related to programming. When we find these online events, we will re-post the information here so that you can attend if you wish. We will do our best to make sure they are relevant to what you are learning here.
  - Daily Stand-Ups — In an effort to keep everyone motivated and accountable, we will be hosting quick meetings in the mornings to give you a chance to report to your fellow level-mates your progress AND alert your Project Manager of any blocks you have. These meetings will be run in the popular "Scrum Daily Stand-Up" format so that you also start getting used to this style of meeting which will likely be utilized in your future workplace.
  - Q&A Sessions — You've got questions and we've got answers. Each level will have multiple live group sessions where a mentor will be available to answer questions and discuss relevant technical topics. These Q&A sessions will be level-specific, so the discussion will be relevant to what you are working on now. Join with questions or join just to listen in and learn more. (now known as "Dynamite Sessions")
  - Group Work Sessions — We will be hosting an "open space" style work session several times a week where you can join others in your level while you are studying or working on projects. These sessions will not be facilitated by CodeX staff/faculty, but (hopefully) will be full of learners ready to learn. This is a great time to share your screen and get feedback from other learners, ask or answer questions, or just have a call open in the background while you work.
- Chat community- post questions in #level-1 channel if you need help between mentoring sessions. Entire community can help you.
- How evaluations work
- Earning badges to complete pathways
- Agree to a mentoring cadence.
- Go over Google Meet, audio settings, and screen sharing
- Ask them to share their pathway with you including progress (logged in, pathway screen, share button in upper right)
  - Add this as the channel topic in slack so that it's easy to get to. You'll want to refer to it from time to time.
- Schedule first mentoring session.

Once call is done:
- You will receive a Process form where you can log the time you needed for the kickoff.
