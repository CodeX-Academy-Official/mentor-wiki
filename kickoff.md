# Learner Kickoff Call

Please schedule a quick call with the learner to discuss the following points. You may need to take some notes for your own purposes.
- Your role as a mentor, resource, coach and cheerleader
- Learner’s responsibility to study independently. Mentor sessions are meant to supplement independent study.
- Stay focused on competencies for each badge. Don't over-study or over-learn. Just-in-time learning.
- How suggested learning works 
  - not required, 
  - not even suggested to complete entire lessons, 
  - just learn enough to earn the badges!
  - The items we add to suggested learning SHOULD all be free or have free options that get you what you need. 
  - If you find a course that you like that you want to pay for, that’s your option. It might be a great option especially if the price is good and the content has a lot of good user feedback. Your mentor will STILL be able to work with you if you are using our suggested content or your own. It’s still all about the badge criteria!
- Chat community- post questions in #level-1 channel if you need help between mentoring sessions. Entire community can help you.
- How evaluations work
- Earning badges to complete pathways
- Agree to a mentoring cadence.
- Go over Google Meet, audio settings, and screen sharing
- Ask them to share their pathway with you including progress (logged in, pathway screen, share button in upper right)
  - Add this as the channel topic in slack so that it's easy to get to. You'll want to refer to it from time to time.
- Schedule first mentoring session.
