# Level Orientation Notes

Starting with Level 2, students will need to participate in a live "Level Orientation" meeting with a mentor (preferably with the mentor who will be with them for the current level). Please be ready to help your learner schedule this meeting AND use this document to guide the conversation. There are notes below for all levels and specific levels.

## All Levels

* Go over the level in a screen share and talk about a general "game-plan" for how to work through the badges.
* Look at the project badge at the end of the level together. If the badge indicates, talk through a potential project to shoot for. Get the learner to commit to that project scope. Take some notes together and add those notes to the badge evidence when claiming the badge.
* Discuss a plan for some potential "instructional videos" the learner can make to serve as portfolio pieces and evaluation videos.
* Discuss a goal for completion of the level. Post that goal in the learner's channel as a reminder.
